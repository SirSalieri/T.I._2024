MIKE'S TERMINOPPGAVE:
  __NordPublica__
  

## Description

NordPublica is supposed to be online portal for Newsfeed, weather checking, calendar overview and planning events via user's default calendar-interface.
Newsfeed is supposed to be parted in three:
- BreakingNews,
- Local Newsfeed &
- Sportsnews.

  The goal was basically offering some typical infoservices for public domain of users - those who wish to be updated with daily info. 

  Due to lack of time, so many problems in the installation and, somewhat too bad and complicated conditions for project, the final product is quite imperfect and not fully done. Main Frontend is practicaly totally done, while backend-system is full of empty - unfinished documents.
  
This repository contains code for:

1) Mainpage - index.php;
2) all website's pages:

   - about.html [for describing the NordPublica - their services and history],
   - avatars.html [for logging in / signing up to the portal]
   - calMAP.html [main calendar page; with calendar map with live tracking of the time],
   - calEVENTS.html [calendar-oriented element for making and remembering the events user makes on this page; ALSO WAS SUPPOSED to work, but due to lack of the time, does not have finished backend],
   - contact.html [includes simple form for inputting contact info of the user and redirects him to the default mail-interface for further communication],
   - sports.php [for loking into sports articles],
   - weather.html [for weather overview]

  Every of these have their own role in the service of this page. They are 'here or there' incomplete, unfunctional or have bare frontend elements.
  Anyway, the movement between the pages, responsitivity of the website and UI is more or less done, what is resulted with this - medium-quality standard interface.

## Installation

Installation tutorial will be provided lively, during the project's premiere-presentation!

## Usage

The website's final purpose could be parted in two possible usages:
1) One usage type can be explained as Admin's control over users (logging history, all registered users, data managment and 'publishing-backend' system interface / frontend for publishing and editing);
2) Complete Public-user fascilities -
   - Reading articles
      * Local Newsfeed,
      * Sportsnews &
      * Breaking newsfeed;
    - Checking wether;
    - Checking calendar;
    - Logging in and registering as a public user &
    - Contacting Administration.
    -
